# Controls when the action will run. 
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - develop
      
  pull_request:
    branches: 
      - main
      - develop

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
